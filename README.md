# Decision-tree-induction-algorithm-for-classification-tasks
the aim of the assignment is to :
implement a decision tree induction algorithm for classification tasks;
make sure it works for real value features and nominal features(categorical features without rank, like red, blue and green...);
test the algorithm on the three datasets
